# YoloV3
Built an Object detection/classification model using YoloV3.

How to run the project:
- Install opencv2
- Run the file yolov3.py
- make sure you start with "tiny" weights and config. [Just to be smooth]
- The Accuracy depends on model/config/weights that has been used. Higher the weights more the usage and slower frames.

You can download the weight files for any YoloV3 config model - https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
